    <p align="left">I'm _newmoon13 (aka Lilly)!
       I am the top artist of BenXCool Studios.
       I created most of the entities in Abyssal Descent, because.. yeah.
       ANYWAYS, I mostly also created the lore for the entities, and so on.
       I've certainly loved drawing monsters at the age of 6.
       My parents were always horrified by my drawings, but I pretty much liked them.
       Scratch is actually inspired by one of my old drawings!
       I kept drawing and drawing till my monsters looked so horrible, that my teachers even got trauma from me!
       Anyways.. that's all!!! BYE</p>
